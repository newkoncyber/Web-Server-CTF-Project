# Web-Server-CTF-Project

Conduct a penetration test and security assessment of the ENPM685 Grade Server. The goal of this penetration test and security assessment is to show the administrators of the ENPM685 Grade Server that their security posture needs to be improved. 

The Assignment and Requirements
Conduct a penetration test of the ENPM685 grade server and report your findings.

There are 4 “flags” spread out across the server. By finding these you can demonstrate to the ENPM685 administration of the need to make security improvements. A top grade can only be attained by finding all 4 flags.

What is a flag? It will be a short phrase or other interesting information you discover during your penetration test. For example, if the flag is a file (named “flagX_is_inside” it will be the contents of the file, not just the file name/location. 

They are clearly marked, you will know them when you see them.

If a file is a flag the CONTENT of the file is the actual flag, not just the file name

Flags are not in any order; you don’t need to find them in order

The Rules of Engagement:

Use any tools you feel are appropriate to properly test the ENPM685 grade service computers for security vulnerabilities.

Asking other people to assist you with this project is NOT PERMITTED. However, if you are stuck you may ask the professor for a hint via email. You are given ONE hint that will not affect your grade. If that hint is not enough that “hint” will be valid until you are able to find one of the flags. 
You may ask for (and be provided) more hints for additional flags if needed but extra hints will affect your grade.

Technical questions about importing the virtual machine for this assignment do NOT count towards your hint count.

Asking a question to verify what you think is a flag is actually a flag does NOT count towards your hint count.

Please direct all questions for help with this final to the professor via email. 

Booting the VM into a single user/recovery mode is NOT PERMITTED.

Changing a password of any kind is NOT PERMITTED.

The Report

Once you have finished your security assessment you need to write up your findings and how you discovered the flags you did. What should be in your report:

 
Your name
UID number (e.g., 103946946)

Course and section information (e.g., ENPM685 0201)

The Honor Pledge

“I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this assignment/examination.”

What flags you found (to receive a top grade you’ll need to find all 4)
How you discovered those flags
